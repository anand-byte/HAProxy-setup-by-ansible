# HAProxy-setup-by-ansible
## In this setup you need to divide the  IP of the inventory into two group, one with the name "web_server" and other with the name "load_balancer". The load_balancer will contain the public IP of the system to be configured as HAProxy while the web_server group will contain the IPs of the system to be configured as target webserver.
